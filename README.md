# 3D-UNet-PyTorch-Implementation
This is the implementation of 3D UNet Proposed by Özgün Çiçek et al., for details please refer to: [3D U-Net: Learning Dense Volumetric Segmentation from Sparse Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650).

Dataset used: [Soft-tissue-Sarcoma](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Soft-tissue-Sarcoma), the dataset I used has been processed by other people and due to some reasons I cannot share it here. If you want to use it for you work, please refer to the MATLAB code provided and convert the images into proper format for further processing and analysis.
